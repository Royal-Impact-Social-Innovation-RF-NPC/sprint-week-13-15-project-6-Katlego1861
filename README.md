# ♻️ Smart Waste Sorter using ESP32-CAM and Edge Impulse

This project is an **AI-powered waste sorting system** that uses an **ESP32-CAM** and **Edge Impulse** machine learning model to automatically identify and sort waste items such as **plastic**, **paper**, and **organic**.  
The system combines **AI**, **IoT**, and **robotics** to promote smarter and cleaner waste management.

##  Artificial Intelligence (Edge Impulse Integration)

The AI model was created using **Edge Impulse** to classify waste materials into categories such as **plastic**, **paper**, **metal**, and **organic**.  

### Process Overview:
1. **Data Collection** – Images of different waste materials were captured using the ESP32-CAM and my phone.  
2. **Data Processing** – Images were resized and processed in Edge Impulse to extract features.  
3. **Model Training** – A MobileNetV2 (96x96) transfer learning model was trained and optimized.  
4. **Testing & Validation** – Model performance was measured (Precision: 0.65, Recall: 0.48, F1 Score: 0.55).  
5. **Deployment** – The trained model was exported as an Arduino library and deployed to the ESP32-CAM.  
6. **Integration** – The ESP32-CAM sends results via **ESP-NOW** to another ESP32 that controls servo motors to direct waste into the correct bin.
